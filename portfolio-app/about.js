  <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! I’m Shanmugaratnam Mohanaranjan — a Junior Software Developer with a focus on front-end development and UI/UX design. I love turning complex problems into elegant, user-friendly interfaces using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Flask.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a BEng in Software Engineering and real-world project experience, I’ve worked on apps that improve how people navigate stores, explore university options, and access online education. My goal is always to build accessible, responsive, and impactful digital products.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and collaboration. Whether I’m designing a new UI in Figma or building out a feature in code, I enjoy learning new tools, refining ideas through feedback, and being part of teams that make a real difference.
